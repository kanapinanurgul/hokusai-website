        Fishing has always been a significant 
        aspect in Japanese life and comes up 
        often in Hokusai's art. The way Hokusai 
        drew the immense mountain is much more 
        simplistic compared to other images. 
        The orange color in the sky gives the 
        impression of a sunrise. Perhaps the 
        mountain is only a silhouette because 
        the morning mist has not yet been 
        dissipated by the warm sun. The water 
        is also very calm; anyone who has seen 
        water early in the morning knows the 
        serenity felt during this time of day. 
        The triangle shape of the mountain is 
        echoed in the triangular shape created 
        by the fisherman and his fishing lines. 
        This technique is fairly unique to Kajikazawa 
        in Kai Province, which makes it a significant 
        piece in Hokusai's incredible collection.
