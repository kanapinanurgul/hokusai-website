        This area was well known in Japan to have 
        rough waves, and they were rarely represented 
        in this time realistically enough to give 
        the viewer an idea of just how brutal they 
        could be. Many other paintings with similar 
        subjects to this one, that were painted around 
        this time, would focus on the human tragedy of 
        the boats being engulfed in the wave, but what 
        makes The Great Wave off Kanagawa so different 
        to paintings Hokusa's contemporaries were doing 
        at the time is that he focused on the raw power 
        of the elements rather than trying to provoke 
        an emotional reaction from the viewer. Another 
        striking thing about the painting, is that the 
        colours are fairly basic while still being 
        striking and unusual. A very small number of 
        colour blocks are used in the piece, in keeping 
        with the simplistic design, but the style manages 
        to separate them out from each other 
        well enough to make the wave stand out.
