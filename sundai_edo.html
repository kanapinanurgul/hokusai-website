        One can clearly see similarities between 
        Sundai Edo and Hokusai's arguably most 
        famous artwork, The Wave of Kangawa. 
        The images of Mount Fuji towering in 
        the background, the pastel-like colours 
        of nature as well as the style of the 
        Japanese people and their clothing. While 
        the thirty six paintings are Houkusai's 
        most notable pieces on Mount Fuji, he 
        released a book later on titled 
        One hundred views of Mount Fuji.

        Sundai Edo itself portrays Japanese farmers 
        at work in the Edo period. Meanwhile, 
        Mount Fuji looms far in the distance and 
        examples of traditional Japanese 
        architecture is visible in the foreground. 
        With the trees a dark shade of green and 
        the ground being verdant and grassy, it's 
        likely a depiction of Japan's luscious summer.
