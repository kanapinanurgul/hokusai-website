# hokusai-website
My repository to store my first website ever. It is dedicated to the famous Japanese artist Hokusai.

* `main.html` is the starting page - everything can be accessed from there.
* `end.css` is a css file that sets those amazing fonts and colours, so don't forget to use it as well!
* Other files contain specific information about works of the authors as well as his short biography.

Please enjoy and feel free to comment!
