        Known as Tokitaro during his childhood 
        days, the man who is now famously known 
        as Katsushika Hokusai showed every sign 
        of a great artist. Like with most of 
        the greatest artists who ever walked the 
        earth, no one noticed his prowess until 
        much later when the grey hair, and 
        especially the balding head, was already 
        setting in. Although his earlier work is 
        considered a marvel by many arts critics, 
        he never gained recognition until he was 
        commissioned to produce a series named 
        thirty-six views of Mount Fuji. One of 
        the works in the series — The Great Wave 
        — won him instant fame.
