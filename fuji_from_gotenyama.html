        The picture shows picnic spot, with people chatting,
        relaxing, and eating under the shade of cherry trees,
        which dominate the landscape. Beyond the picnic 
        spot are hills, and the Sagami Bay stretches out
        into the distance. The sky is a clear blue, 
        indicating a nice day for picnicking families. Far in 
        the background, Mount Fuji can be seen. The mountain 
        is not the focus of the picture at all. It is the 
        cherry blossoms which take up all the attention with 
        their lovely and eye-catching pink shade. The picture 
        on the whole presents a very serene and 
        relaxed atmosphere of people having fun.

        The prevalence of the mountain in Hokusai's 
        works has a religious significance since Mount Fuji is 
        a representation of immortal and eternal life in 
        Japanese Buddhism. Hokusai was a Buddhist of the 
        Nichiren sect and hence gave special attention to the 
        sacred mountain in his various art works. The Fuji from 
        Gotenyama at Shinagawa on the Tokaido was originally 
        created in 1833 and is currently housed in the British Museum.
